## The Federation Operator enables the entity as descendant

- from the admin panel a staff user can enable the entity as a FederationDescendant
- all the required information are moved (copied) from the OnBoarding registration 
- the staff user assigns a Descendant Profile (trust mark) to the onboarded entity
 (See the example in the documentation [CREATE_A_FEDERATION.md](../CREATE_A_FEDERATION.md#register-an-entity-as-descendant) )
 see "Register an entity as descendant".
- the staff user in any time can add more profiles and trust marks through the FederationDescendant back office panel
- an entity configuration with trust marks and metadata policy applied, signed by the Trust Anchor of the onboarding system,
 is now available to its __Resolve Entity Statement__ endpoint.

To enable the onboarded entity, the Federation Operator points its web browser to the admin panel:

- Click OnBoarding Registrations
- Select the entity you want to enable 
- Select action "enable descendant"
- Submit
