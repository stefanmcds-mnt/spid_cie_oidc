# Pyppeteer 

Note: When you run pyppeteer for the first time, it downloads the latest version of Chromium (~150MB) if it is not found on your system. If you don't prefer this behavior, ensure that a suitable Chrome binary is installed. One way to do this is to run pyppeteer-install command before prior to using this library.
